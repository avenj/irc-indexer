- keep Trawlers and Reports, maybe with minor rework (interface roles?)
- write Emitter layer that can manage any kind of trawler set
- write HTTP and ZMQ listeners

Masters
  - Fork Trawlers, optionally keepalive Trawlers
  - Speak ZMQ+JSON to Trawlers
  - Generate Reports
    Reports can stay as-is, probably
    Optional 'publish when generated' 

Trawlers
  - Slimmed-down IRC transport?
    Can either use Backend directly or Client::Lite
  - Speak ZMQ+JSON to Masters

Frontends
  - HTTP

Logging
  - Kill Log::Handler in favor of faster logger

DB
  - Add SQL options?
  - Add DB_File / flatfile persistency and querying?
    needs to be accessible via misc frontends (zmq, http etc)
